Developed a comprehensive web scraping tool to extract real estate data from MagicBricks, aimed at providing insights into the property market in Bangalore. This project entailed several key tasks and achievements:

- **Data Extraction**: Utilized Python with BeautifulSoup to scrape detailed property information, including price, location, area, amenities, tenant preferences, security deposit, and owner details.
- **Data Processing**: Implemented data cleaning techniques to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the scraped data.
- **Data Storage**: Stored the extracted data in multiple CSV files categorized by locality.
- **Data Integration**: Merged multiple CSV files into a single Excel workbook, with each sheet named after its corresponding locality, using Pandas and XlsxWriter.
- **Automation**: Automated the scraping process to handle multiple pages and different localities efficiently.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, XlsxWriter.

**Project Outcomes**:
- Successfully scraped and compiled extensive property data from several localities in Bangalore.
- Enabled detailed analysis and comparison of real estate trends across different areas.
- Provided a scalable solution for ongoing data updates and expansions to other cities or property types.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in web scraping, data processing, and automation, as well as my ability to handle real-world data challenges.
